# Bookmarklet for Yandex Search

Extract information from the results in Yandex.ru search engine.

This is what you get:

- Organic items: title, URL shown in the SERP, URL and meta-description (the long description in case of item with short and full text)
- Paid items: title, URL (not the real one), text of the ad.
- Related searchs
- Suggestions from Yandex.ru

You may need to show the suggestions (just clicking on the search box) in order to get these items in the generated text.

Once you make a search in Yandex.ru, you can run this script from the browser's console and you will get all the information in a new page. Then, you can save it as text document and open it with your favourite software to work with this data.

You can also convert this script into a bookmarket to use it from the bookmarks toolbar in your browser.
